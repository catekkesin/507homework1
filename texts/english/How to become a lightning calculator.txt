Instantaneous Addition.





Accuracy should be first considered, then rapidity. Quick adders, by

the way, are the most accurate. Write the numbers in vertical lines,

avoiding irregularity. This is important. Keep your thought on results

not numbers themselves. Do not reckon 7 and 4 are 11 and 8 are 19, but

say 7, 11, 19 and so on.



When the same number is repeated several times, multiply instead of

adding.



When adding horizontally begin at the left.

In adding long columns, prove the work, by adding each column

separately in the opposite direction, before adding the next column.

Many accountants put down both figures as in the illustration. The sum

of the first column is 12; carrying _one_, the sum of the second is

20; carrying _two_, the sum of the third column is 15; carrying _one_,

the sum of the fourth column is 21, and the total, 21502, is found by

calling off the last two figures and the right-hand figures, following

the wave line in the illustration. This method is better than the old

one of penciling down the number _to carry_. If one desires to go back

and add a certain column a second time, the number to carry is at hand

and the former total is known.

To the inexperienced it will be a difficult task to add two columns at

once, but many of those who have daily practice in addition find it

about as easy to add two columns as one. Say 99 and 50 are 149, and 6

are 155, and 10 and 50 are 215 and 3 are 218, and 12 are 230. Carry 2,

and say 33 and 12 are 45, and 20 are 65, and 6 are 71, and 30 are 101,

and 2 are 103, and 23 are 126.

Multiplication.





To Multiply Any Number by 11.



Write the first right-hand figure, add the first and second, the second

and third, and so on; then write the left-hand figure. Carry when

necessary.



219434 × 11 = 2413774



Put down the right-hand figure 4. Then say, 4 and 3 are 7; then, 3 and

4 are 7; then, 4 and 9 are 13, put down 3 and carry 1; then, 9 and 1

and 1 are 11, put down the 1 and carry 1; then, 1 and 2 and 1 are 4;

then write the left-hand figure 2. In multiplying small numbers, such

as 24 by 11, write the sum of the two figures between the two figures,

making 264, the required product.





To Multiply by 101, 1001, etc.



To multiply by 101, add two ciphers to the multiplicand, and add to

this the multiplicand.



2341 × 101 = 234100 + 2341



To multiply by 1001, add three ciphers to the multiplicand, and add to

this the multiplicand.





To Multiply by 5, 25, 125.



To multiply by 5, add a cipher and divide by 2.



To multiply by 25, add two ciphers and divide by 4.



To multiply by 125, add three ciphers and divide by 8.





Another Easy Way to Multiply.

To multiply two figures by two figures, proceed as follows: Multiply

units by units for the _first_ figure.



Carry and multiply tens by units and units by tens, (adding) for the

_second_ figure. Carry and multiply tens by tens for the _remaining_

figure or figures. In this example proceed as follows:



  2 × 4 = 8 = 1st figure.

  (4 × 8) + (5 × 2) = 42. Therefore 2 = 2d figure.

  (5 × 8) + 4 carried = 44 = 3d and 4th figures.



By a little practice any one may become as familiar with this rule and

as ready in its application as with the ordinary method.



To multiply any number by 2-1/2, add one cipher, and divide by 4.



To multiply any number by 3-1/3, add one cipher, and divide by 3.



To multiply by 33-1/3, add two ciphers, and divide by 3.



To multiply any number by 1-3/7, add one cipher, and divide by 7.



To multiply by 16-2/3, add two ciphers, and divide by 6.



To multiply by 14-2/7, add two ciphers, and divide by 7.



To multiply by 875, add three ciphers, and divide by 8.



To divide by 25, multiply by 4, and cut off two figures.



To divide by 125, multiply by 8, and cut off three figures.



To multiply by 12-1/2, add two ciphers, and divide by 8.



To find the value of any number of articles at 75 cents each, deduct

one-quarter of the number from itself and call the remainder dollars.





To Subtract Any Number Consisting of Two Figures from 100.



Take the first figure from 9, and the second from 10. For example: in

subtracting 73 from 100, or in taking 73 cents change out of a dollar,

say 7 from 9 and 2, and 3 from 10 and 7, or 27 cents. Practice this

rule. It is simple, and will be found particularly helpful in making

change.





Divisions.



A number is divisible by 2 when the last digit is even.



A number is divisible by 4 when the last two digits are divisible by 4.



To divide by 12-1/2, multiply by 8, and cut off two figures.





Simple Discount Rule.



This simple rule is in use in many houses where several discounts are

allowed from list prices. Suppose the list price of a piano to be $500,

and you allow an agent 25, 20 and 10 off.



  100   100    100

   25    20     10

  ---   ---    ---

   75 ×  80  ×  90  =  .540000



Subtract each from 100 and multiply and you get .54. $500 × .54 = $270,

the agent’s price.

Percentage.



The name percentage is applied to certain arithmetical exercises

in which 100 is used as the basis of computation. Per cent. is an

abbreviation of the Latin _per centum_, meaning _by the hundred_. This

sign % is used for the words _per cent._ Thus, 10% of a number equals

10/100, or 1/10 of the number; 50% equals 50/100, or 1/2, etc.



  FRACTIONAL EQUIVALENTS.



  50     % = .50     = 1/2.

  33-1/3 % = .33-1/3 = 1/3.

  25     % = .25     = 1/4.

  20     % = .20     = 1/5.

  16-2/3 % = .16-2/3 = 1/6.

  12-1/2 % = .12-1/2 = 1/8.

  10     % = .10     = 1/10.

   8-1/3 % = .08-1/3 = 1/12.

   6-1/4 % = .06-1/4 = 1/16.

   5     % = .05     = 1/20.

   2-1/2 % = .02-1/2 = 1/40.









Accurate Interest.





Interest is the sum charged for the use of money. It is really the _use

of money_ or the benefit derived from its use. The principal is the

sum for the use of which interest is paid. The rate of interest is the

_per cent._ of the principal charged for its use for _one year_. Simple

interest is the interest on the principal only, for the full time;

compound interest is interest on the principal for the full time, and

interest on each interest payment after it becomes due.



To find the accurate interest on any sum of money at a given rate for

one year, multiply the sum by the rate and divide by 100.



To find the accurate interest on any sum of money at a given rate for

any given number of days, multiply the interest for one year by the

number of days and divide the product by 365.









Equation of Payments.





Equation of Payments is the process of finding when two or more sums

due at different times may be paid at once, without loss to debtor or

creditor. The time for such payment is called the equated time.



To equate two or more payments, multiply each payment by its time, and

divide the sum of the products by the sum of the payments.



The times of the several payments must be in the same denomination, and

this will be the denomination of the answer.



Less than 1/2 day is rejected; 1/2 day or more counts as 1 day. If the

date is required, reckon the equated time forward from the given date.

There are experts who can add very rapidly. The best of them, however,

cannot add up a column of _ones_ any faster than you can. Here is how

some of the rapid addition is performed. The operator writes a line of

figures, then another, and so on. The second line, however, added to

the first makes _nines_, except at the extreme right, where the two

figures add to _ten_. The third and fourth bear the same relation, and

as many more as he chooses to put down. The last two lines, however,

are put down at random. Now, to add these columns, he begins anywhere,

perhaps at the left-hand side, putting down 2 (the number of _pairs_

above), then by simply adding the two bottom lines, he gets the correct

sum.









Bank Discount.





The sum charged by a bank for cashing a note or time draft is

called bank discount. This _discount_ is the simple interest, paid

in advance, for the number of days the note has to run. Wholesale

business houses usually sell goods on time and take notes from the

retailers in payment. These notes are not often for a longer period

than three months. Some are placed in the banks for _collection_,

others are discounted. When a note is discounted at a bank the _payee_

endorses it, making it payable to the bank. Both maker and payee are

then responsible to the bank for its payment. If the note is drawing

interest the discount is reckoned on and deducted from the amount due

at maturity. Most notes discounted at banks do not draw interest. The

time in bank discount is always the number of days from the _date of

discounting_ to the _date of maturity_.



Example. A note of $250, dated July 7th, payable in 60 days, is

discounted July 7th, at 6 per cent.; find the proceeds.



This note is due in 63 days, or September 8th. The accurate interest of

$250 for 63 days at 6 per cent. is $2.59. The proceeds, then, will be

$250 - $2.59, or $247.41.









How to Make Change.





Salesmen usually make change by addition. They have the money to count

out, and in doing so they add to the amount of the purchase until

they reach the amount of the bill presented. For example, if you buy

something worth $3.35 and present a ten-dollar bill in payment, you

will probably receive in return 5 cents, 10 cents, 50 cents, $1, and

$5; the salesman saying 40, 50, $4, $5; $10. This method is least

liable to error.



Accuracy and rapidity in counting out change can best be acquired by

practice behind the counter or at the cash-desk.









Proof of Multiplication in Ten Seconds.





The _unitate_ of a number is the sum of its digits reduced to a unit.



     252 = 9 } = 54 = 9

     321 = 6 }

    ---

    252

   504

  756

  -----

  80892 = 27 = 9



The _unitate_ of the multiplier is 9 and the _unitate_ of the

multiplicand is 6; 6 times 9 equals 54, and the _unitate_ of 54 is 9.

Now the _unitate_ of the product is found to be 9 also, which is a

proof of the correctness of the work.









The Canadian Interest Rule.





  4 | 724

      181 × 11 = 19.91



This rule of computing interest appears in some Canadian text-books,

and, though simply a modification of other rules, is worthy of notice.

To find the interest on $724 for 5-1/2 months at 6 per cent., all you

have to do is to divide by 4 and multiply by 11. The rule is to divide

the principal by 4, and to multiply the quotient by one-third of the

product of the rate by the time in months. _Six_ times 5-1/2 = 33, and

one-third of 33 is 11. If the time be expressed in years, multiply

one-fifth of the principal by one-half the product of the rate by the

number of years, and remove the decimal point one place to the left.

Explanation of Foregoing Table.



The transposition of figures is a frequent cause of errors in proving

accounts and balance sheets. This table is founded on the fact that

all differences between transposed numbers are multiples of nine. The

difference between the figures misplaced is equal to the quotient of

the resulting error when divided by nine; thus, 91 - 19 = 72; 72 ÷

9 = 8; 9 - 1 = 8, and the labor of searching for it may be confined

to examining those figures the transposition of which would make the

difference, as they are the only ones that can cause the error. Thus:

if the error in the balance-sheet be 81 cents, it is possibly caused

by a transposition, and the clerk can first examine the cents column

of his books for items of 90 cents, or 09 cents, alone, with a strong

probability of finding the cause of the error without further revision.

Transpositions may occur in any decimal or integer place, and the

differences caused thereby are divisible by nine without a remainder;

but, beyond this table, the numbers ascend in regular progression, each

difference increasing by nine, as follows:



  108 { 120; 117 { 130; 126 { 140; etc.

      {  12      {  13      {  14



The quotient of the difference in a regular progression, when divided

by nine, gives the figures transposed, thus: 130 - 13 = 117 ÷ 9 = 13,

which are the figures to be sought for when a discrepancy of 117 is

shown; but this will not apply to differences below 81, nor to mixed

transpositions. An error divisible by two may be caused by posting an

item to the wrong side of the ledger.









Short Method to Find the Interest of a Given Sum.





Reduce the time to months, and to the number thus found annex one-third

of the days, which whole number multiplied by one-half of your

principal will produce you the required interest in dollars, cents and

mills, at 6 per cent. If days only are given, multiply one-third of the

days by one-half of the principal for the required interest at 6 per

cent. Note these exercises:



$250 at 6% for 8 mos. 6 ds. = 82 × 125 = $10.25.



$250 at 6% for 93 ds. = 31 × 125 = $3.88.



$250 at 6% for 9 mos. = 9 × 125 = $11.25.



In some respects this rule is superior to the well-known 60-day method

of reckoning interest.









Interest Computations.





            462.50

               .48

            -------

  6 | 360

     ----

       60 | 222.0000 | 3.70



Multiply the _principal_ (amount of money at interest) by the time,

reduced to days; then divide this product by the quotient obtained

by dividing 360 (the number of days in the interest year) by the per

cent. of interest, and the quotient thus obtained will be the required

interest. Require the interest of $462.50 for one month and eighteen

days at 6 per cent. An interest month is 30 days; one month and 18 days

equals 48 days. $462.50 multiplied by .48 gives $222.0000; 360 divided

by 6 (the per cent. of interest) gives 60, and $222.0000 divided by

60 will give you the exact interest, which is $3.70. If the rate of

interest in the above example were 12 per cent., we would divide the

$222.0000 by 30 (because 360 divided by 12 gives 30); if 4 per cent.,

we would divide by 90; if 8 per cent., by 45; and in like manner for

any other per cent.

1.F.



1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Defect you cause.



Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™



Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

from people in all walks of life.



Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will

remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Literary Archive Foundation



Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread

public support and donations to carry out its mission of

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest

array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

status with the IRS.



The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.



While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

approach us with offers to donate.



International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.



Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.



Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works



Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project

Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be

freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and

distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of

volunteer support.



Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed

editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in

the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not

necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper

edition.



Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

facility: www.gutenberg.org.



This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
