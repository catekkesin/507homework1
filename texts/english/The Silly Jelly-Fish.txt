THE SILLY JELLY-FISH.





Once upon a time the King of the Dragons, who had till then lived as a

bachelor, took it into his head to get married. His bride was a young

Dragonette just sixteen years old,--lovely enough, in very sooth, to

become the wife of a King. Great were the rejoicings on the occasion.

The Fishes, both great and small, came to pay their respects, and to

offer gifts to the newly wedded pair; and for some days all was feasting

and merriment.



[Illustration]



But alas! even Dragons have their trials. Before a month had passed, the

young Dragon Queen fell ill. The doctors dosed her with every medicine

that was known to them, but all to no purpose. At last they shook their

heads, declaring that there was nothing more to be done. The illness

must take its course, and she would probably die. But the sick Queen

said to her husband:



[Illustration]



"I know of something that will cure me. Only fetch me a live Monkey's

liver to eat, and I shall get well at once."--"A live Monkey's liver!"

exclaimed the King. "What are you thinking of, my dear? Why! you forget

that we Dragons live in the sea, while Monkeys live far away from here,

among the forest-trees on land. A Monkey's liver! Why! darling, you

must be mad." Hereupon the young Dragon Queen burst into tears: "I only

ask you for one small thing," whimpered she, "and you won't get it for

me. I always thought you didn't really love me. Oh! I wish I had staid

at home with my own m-m-m-mama and my own papa-a-a-a!" Here her voice

choked with sobs, and she could say no more.



[Illustration]



Well, of course the Dragon King did not like to have it thought that

he was unkind to his beautiful young wife. So he sent for his trusty

servant the Jelly-Fish, and said: "It is rather a difficult job; but

what I want you to try to do is to swim across to the land, and

persuade a live Monkey to come here with you. In order to make the

Monkey willing to come, you can tell him how much nicer everything

is here in Dragon-Land than away where he lives. But what I really

want him for is to cut out his liver, and use it as medicine for your

young Mistress, who, as you know, is dangerously ill."



[Illustration]



So the Jelly-Fish went off on his strange errand. In those days he was

just like any other fish, with eyes, and fins, and a tail. He even had

little feet, which made him able to walk on the land as well as to swim

in the water. It did not take him many hours to swim across to the

country where the Monkeys lived; and fortunately there just happened to

be a fine Monkey skipping about among the branches of the trees near

the place where the Jelly-Fish landed. So the Jelly-Fish said: "Mr.

Monkey! I have come to tell you of a country far more beautiful than

this. It lies beyond the waves, and is called Dragon-Land. There is

pleasant weather there all the year round, there is always plenty of

ripe fruit on the trees, and there are none of those mischievous

creatures called Men. If you will come with me, I will take you there.

Just get on my back."



[Illustration]



The Monkey thought it would be fun to see a new country. So he leapt on

to the Jelly-Fish's back, and off they started across the water. But

when they had gone about half-way, he began to fear that perhaps there

might be some hidden danger. It seemed so odd to be fetched suddenly in

that way by a stranger. So he said to the Jelly-Fish: "What made you

think of coming for me?" The Jelly-Fish answered: "My Master, the King

of the Dragons, wants you in order to cut out your liver, and give it

as medicine to his wife, the Queen, who is sick."



[Illustration]



"Oh! that's your little game,--is it?" thought the Monkey. But he kept

his thoughts to himself and only said: "Nothing could please me better

than to be of service to Their Majesties. But it so happens that I left

my liver hanging to a branch of that big chestnut-tree, which you found

me skipping about on. A liver is a thing that weighs a good deal. So I

generally take it out, and play about without it during the day-time. We

must go back for it."--The Jelly-Fish agreed that there was nothing

else to be done under the circumstances. For,--silly creature that he

was,--he did not see that the Monkey was telling a story in order to

avoid getting killed, and having his liver used as medicine for the

fanciful young Dragon Queen.



[Illustration]



When they reached the shore of Monkey-Land again, the monkey bounded

off the Jelly-Fish's back, and up to the topmost branch of the

chestnut-tree in less than no time. Then he said: "I do not see my liver

here. Perhaps somebody has taken it away. But I will look for it. You,

meantime, had better go back and tell your Master what has happened. He

might be anxious about you, if you did not get home before dark."



[Illustration]



So the Jelly-Fish started off a second time; and when he got home, he

told the Dragon King everything just as it had happened. But the King

flew into a passion with him for his stupidity, and hallooed to his

officers, saying: "Away with this fellow! Take him, and beat him to a

jelly! Don't let a single bone remain unbroken in his body!" So the

officers seized him, and beat him, as the King had commanded. That is

the reason why, to this very day, Jelly-Fishes have no bones, but are

just nothing more than a mass of pulp.



[Illustration]



As for the Dragon Queen, when she found she could not have the Monkey's

liver,--why! she made up her mind that the only thing to do was to get

well without it.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™



Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

from people in all walks of life.



Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will

remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation



The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.



The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact



Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Literary Archive Foundation



Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread

public support and donations to carry out its mission of

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest

array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

status with the IRS.



The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.



While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

approach us with offers to donate.



International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.



Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.



Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works



Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project

Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be

freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and

distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of

volunteer support.



Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed

editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in

the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not

necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper

edition.



Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

facility: www.gutenberg.org.



This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
